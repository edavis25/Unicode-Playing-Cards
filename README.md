PHP classes to create a deck/shoe of Unicode playing cards
---
A series of PHP classes that can be used to create decks of Unicode playing cards. Currently, this repo is nothing more than a set of objects and tests for creating different types of playing card decks. This project is simply an attempt at furthering my knowledge of fundamental OOP principles.

OOP is fun :)

#### Basic Inheritance Model
